# Sami-Barghout-CRM | Computer Building
***
This is a CRM to organize customers looking to have computers built for them. 

## Key Features

There will be login, space for customers, computer parts, 3D representational model of the computers as parts are added and updated, and compare/contrast space for purchasing high quality parts at the lowest price. Additional features will be added to this CRM after initial build of these 5 key features. Existing features will be documented thoroughly after they are built to ensure relation of feature to intended use is intact from build to build. Updates to the CRM will be built with version control, security testing, and quality testing completed before new feature releases.
